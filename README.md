# Simple Web Wallet - The End

Thank you for your interest in ConseilJS. Throughout this tutorial we showed you how to integrate some of the ConseilJS functions into a React project to create a super simple Tezos web wallet. Once again, this web wallet is no where near production quality. Although the back-end, Conseil, is secure, the front end requires a lot more work to make it ready for Mainnet usage.

To run the wallet and see the final version of it, enter the URLs and API Keys for your working instances of Conseil and Tezos Servers in the `src/utils/servers.js`, then run `npm start`.

If you are not interested in running your own instances of Conseil and Tezos servers just yet, and want to give ConseilJS a spin, join our [developers channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cryptonomic-developers:cryptonomic.tech) in Riot or send us an [email](mailto:support@cryptonomic.tech) and ask for an API key to access our servers.

Looking forward to seeing your next incredible project running on ConseilJS. Happy Hacking!
