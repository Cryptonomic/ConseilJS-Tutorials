# Simple Web Wallet - Step 2 Complete

Enter the URLs and API Keys for your working instances of Conseil and Tezos Servers in the `src/utils/servers.js`, then run `npm start`.

If you are not interested in running your own instances of Conseil and Tezos servers just yet, join our [developers channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cryptonomic-developers:cryptonomic.tech) in Riot and ask for an API key to access our servers.

When you are ready, proceed to the final step:

```bash
git checkout web-wallet/step-3
```
